Mod 5 Project

Project Overview:
- An interactive website where users can explore and donate to nonprofit projects from around the world.

- Users create a profile where they can specify their top-3 themes (Education, Children, Environment etc) and a default country.

- The map page is where a world map is displayed where the users can hover and discover how many available projects they can donate to in every country.

- They can also filter by any of the project themes to visualize which countries have the highest concentration of projects.

- The user can click on a country to view summaries of all the projects and can favourite individual projects or donate to them.
